# PaperMinecraft
The goal of this project is to eventaully have a fully functional 2D version of Minecraft that runs in any browser. Much will be kept consistent across Minecraft and this game although if the basic features of Minecraft are all implemented, it may branch out into a more unique game. This project is an HTML continuation of https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/487046201/.

**Play the game here: https://minicoder11.github.io/PaperMinecraft/**


## Inspirations:
- https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10128407 by Griffpatch
- Minecraft by Mojang Studios

## Credit
All credit to the original textures of Minecraft that are used in this game goes to Mojang Studios. If Mojang Studios feels as though this project is misusing their textures or they would not like them to be used in this way, please contact me by opening an issue on this repository. I will remove all Mojang-created textures immediately upon request of their owners.
