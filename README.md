# PaperMinecraft
The goal of this project is to eventaully have a fully functional 2D version of Minecraft that runs in any browser. Much will be kept consistent across Minecraft and this game although if the basic features of Minecraft are all implemented, it may branch out into a more unique game. This project is an HTML continuation of https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/487046201/.
